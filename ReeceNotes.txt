1. update Robot/networking.py line 33 to return Tuple with true, update line 36 to return default status and false. Remove sleep on line 36. - DONE
2. In Robot/robot.py add a check to see if we get a valid connection, if not, sleep(2) - DONE
3. Check placeholder code on components.py, test thoroughly. Mainly motors and servos
4. Check shellscript for LOS test
5. Clean up test files
	I think servo_web_test.py is our main guy. Leave this where it be
6. List of all sensors that we will have, encoders and sensors - Using 4 quad encoders, 1 on each wheel, 4 distance sensors, 1 on each side, for now
	Create object in webserver - DONE
7. Get servo min/max values
8. In basestation, implement getsensordata - DONE
9. Create GUI, hook to basestation - DONE

From above list:
3. Check placeholder code on components.py, test thoroughly. Mainly motors and servos
4. Check shellscript for LOS test
5. Clean up test files
	I think servo_web_test.py is our main guy. Leave this where it be
7. Get servo min/max values


Set up method to give random sensor values on robot to test web server
Test that we can pass messages (controller and sensor) back and forth between basestation and robot
Possibly put sensor stuff in separate thread of robot, maybe, idk
